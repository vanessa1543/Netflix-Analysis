#  Netflix Movies & TV Shows Analysis

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using Netflix‚Äôs public dataset to uncover content trends, growth patterns, and insights across genres, countries, and time.

---

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes Netflix's content library ‚Äî including movies and TV shows ‚Äî with the goal of answering:
- How has Netflix‚Äôs content grown over the years?
- Which types of content dominate the platform?
- What genres and countries are most represented?
- Are there seasonal or yearly spikes in content additions?

---

##  Data Cleaning

The original dataset (`netflix_titles.csv`) was cleaned to:
- Handle missing values in `director`, `cast`, and `country`
- Convert and standardize `date_added` using `format='mixed'`
- Extract `year_added` and `month_added` for trend analysis
- Strip whitespace and unify textual fields
- Create a new `main_genre` column from the first listed genre
